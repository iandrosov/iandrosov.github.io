Technical Architect after quarter century in this industry still coding my way through the Cloud.

### More Information

This blog name was inspired by an old film "[7 Years in Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years_in_Tibet_(1997_film))" like a film's character a remarkable adventure
of a man transformed by his experiences. I traded my hardware centered programming career for the cloud 10 years ago, when I started to work with Salesforce.com, AWS, Google and all things Mobile. Hmm It has been 10 years to reflect on this journe.

It is continue to be a transformational journey filled with learning experiences. On this Cloudy path I visited many places, 
Salesforce, Force.com, Amazon Web Service, Google, Heroku and Mobile iOS apps and I hope that this will continue to be a 
journey rather than a destination. And I humbly invite you to join as companions along the way.
